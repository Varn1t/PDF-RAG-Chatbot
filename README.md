## 🧠 What is RAG?

Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful, but they don't know the contents of *your* documents. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** solves this by combining a vector search engine with an LLM:

```
Your PDF
   │
   ▼
[Chunking]  →  Split into smaller, overlapping pieces
   │
   ▼
[Embedding]  →  Convert each chunk into a vector (numerical meaning)
   │
   ▼
[FAISS Index]  →  Store vectors for fast similarity search
   │
   ▼
[Your Question]  →  Find the most relevant chunks
   │
   ▼
[LLM + Context]  →  Generate a grounded, accurate answer ✅
```

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Component | Tool |
|---|---|
| 🤖 LLM | `llama3` via [Ollama](https://ollama.com) |
| 🔢 Embeddings | `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` (HuggingFace Sentence Transformers) |
| 🗄️ Vector Store | FAISS (CPU) |
| 📑 PDF Parsing | LangChain + PyPDF |
| 🖥️ UI | Streamlit |

## 🚀 Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
- [Ollama](https://ollama.com) installed and running
- ~5 GB disk space for the llama3 model

### Step-by-step

**1. Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Varn1t/PDF-RAG-Chatbot.git
cd PDF-RAG-Chatbot
```

**2. Install Python dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**3. Pull the LLM model with Ollama**
```bash
ollama pull llama3
```

**4. Launch the app**
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Then open **http://localhost:8501** in your browser.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Upload** a PDF via the Streamlit file uploader
2. The app **chunks** the PDF into 1,000-character segments with 50-character overlap
3. Each chunk is **embedded** using `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` and stored in a FAISS index
4. When you ask a question, the **top 3 most relevant chunks** are retrieved
5. Those chunks are passed as context to **llama3**, which generates a precise answer
