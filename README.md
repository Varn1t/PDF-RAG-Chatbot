## 🧠 What is this?

Most RAG demos stop at "retrieve chunks → generate answer." This project goes further — it uses a **LangGraph state-machine agent** that grades its own answers across two independent dimensions, detects failures, and automatically rewrites queries with targeted awareness of *what went wrong* before re-retrieving.

The agent catches two distinct failure modes that most RAG systems miss:
- **Hallucination** — the answer contains claims not supported by the retrieved chunks
- **Retrieval mismatch** — the chunks were retrieved but didn't match the intent of the query (e.g. asked for *examples*, got *limitations*)

On top of that, it has **conversational memory** — follow-up questions like *"give examples for it"* are automatically rephrased into standalone queries before retrieval, so context is never lost between turns.

Everything runs locally via Ollama and FAISS. No API keys. No data leaving your machine.

## ✨ Features

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| 🔁 **Self-Correcting Agent** | LangGraph loop retries with a rewritten query up to N iterations before giving up gracefully |
| 🎯 **Dual-Graded Verification** | Every answer is graded on both **groundedness** (hallucination check) AND **relevance** (did it actually answer the question?) — both must pass |
| 🔍 **Context-Aware Query Rewriter** | On failure, the rewriter receives the specific failure reason (hallucinated / off-topic / both) and rewrites accordingly |
| 💬 **Conversational Memory** | Resolves pronoun references and follow-up questions using the last N chat turns before retrieval |
| 🕵️ **Agentic Telemetry** | Expandable per-response panel showing every iteration's query, generated answer, retrieved chunks, and dual verdict |
| ⚙️ **Live Parameter Control** | Sidebar sliders for chunk size, overlap, top-K retrieval, max correction iterations, and memory window |
| 🔄 **Smart Re-indexer** | Detects when sidebar parameters differ from the active vector index and prompts a targeted rebuild |
| 📄 **PDF Support** | Drag-and-drop local PDF ingestion via PyPDF |
| 🎥 **YouTube Support** | Paste any YouTube URL to auto-fetch and query its transcript |
| 🔒 **Fully Local** | Ollama + FAISS CPU — zero API costs, zero tracking, total privacy |
| 🖥️ **CLI Mode** | Full terminal interface via `main.py` with diagnostic iteration logs |

## 🏗️ How the Agent Works

```
User Question
     │
     ▼
[contextualize_query]  →  Rephrase follow-ups using chat history (e.g. "it" → "Expert Systems")
     │
     ▼
[retrieve]  →  Pull top-K chunks from FAISS vector index
     │
     ▼
[generate]  →  LLM answers using ONLY the retrieved context
     │
     ▼
[check_hallucination]  →  Dual grader: GROUNDED (yes/no) + RELEVANT (yes/no)
     │
     ├── GROUNDED + RELEVANT ────────────────▶ Return answer ✅
     │
     ├── either fails + iterations < N ──────▶ [rewrite_query] → back to [retrieve] 🔄
     │                                              ↑
     │                                    rewriter receives specific
     │                                    failure reason (hallucinated /
     │                                    off-topic / both)
     │
     └── either fails + iterations == N ────▶ "Information not found in document" ❌
```

**Two distinct query rewriting steps exist for two different reasons:**
- **`contextualize_query`** — runs once at the start of each turn to resolve ambiguous references using chat history. Never re-runs during the correction loop.
- **`rewrite_query`** — runs inside the correction loop when dual grading fails. Receives a specific failure reason so the rewrite is targeted, not generic.

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

- **LLM-as-judge** — Implemented dual-graded self-correction; identified that local 8B models have reliability ceiling as LLM-as-judge — production deployment would require a stronger model or dedicated NLI scorer.
- **Single document per session** — the current implementation indexes one source at a time. Multi-document support is a planned upgrade.
- **Local model quality** — grounding and relevance accuracy are directly tied to the capability of the Ollama model you pull. `llama3` is recommended as the minimum.
